= How Blockchain Will Change Software Engineering =

== Introduction ==
In recent years, the emerging concepts of Blockchain and Smart Contract have been gaining sharply increasing attention. More and more researchers and engineers are contributing to this area to form fundamental theories and invent new algorithms. In addition, applications in real-world are also emerging with cryptocurrency as the most typical one. In this report, we are going to describe the basic principles, software tools, pros and cons, and impacts of Blockchain, focusing on the application and effect in software engineering.
