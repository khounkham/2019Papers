</ul>
<h1 id="challenges-and-shortcomings"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Challenges and Shortcomings</h1>
<!-- Describe any current challenges and shortcomings of the use of the technology in software development -->
<p>The basic principles of blockchain appear to be simple, but when it comes to reality the implementation is facing a variety of challenges.<span class="citation" data-cites="reyna2018iot">(Reyna, Martín, Chen, Soler, &amp; Díaz, 2018)</span></p>
<h2 id="scalability-and-performance"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Scalability and Performance</h2>
<p>The basic principle underpinning blockchain is the mechanism of consensus among the network for verification of transactions. Nodes communicate with each other and make decision following predifined rules. Transactions and blocks to be appended to the network requires confirmation from a certain number of nodes in the network. This approach brings about transpancy and trust in blockchain netwok, however, it also increases the time for processing and confirmation of a transaction, thus reduces the throughput (number of transactions per second) and increases the latency.</p>
<h2 id="storage-capacity"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Storage Capacity</h2>
<p>Storage capacity have been a significant challenge in blockchain for long. In main stream blockchain technology, the chain is always growing and each node in the network stores a complete copy of the whole chain with all transactions in them. For example, in Bitcoin there are approximately 1MB per block every 10 min. Although only full nodes (a node that can fully validate transactions and blocks) need to store the whole chain, enormous storage volume are required. <span class="citation" data-cites="reyna2018iot">(Reyna et al., 2018)</span></p>
<h2 id="security"><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Security</h2>
<p>Various vulnerabilities and security issues of Bitcoin protocol are found thanks to thorough analysis by engineers and researchers. The most well-known attack is the 51% attack or majority attack, which can happen if someone controlled at least 51% of nodes in the network because in this situation he/she took complete control of the consensus. In addition, some other attacks, such as double-spend attack, race attacks, and Denial of Service(DoS) are also discovered and investigated. Finally and interestingly, quantum computing could be seen as a dealy threat to blockchain such as Bitcoin because it unprecedented computing power can easily break the current cryptograhy algorithms underpinning blockchains.<span class="citation" data-cites="reyna2018iot">(Reyna et al., 2018)</span></p>
<h2 id="vulnerability-of-smart-contract"><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Vulnerability of Smart Contract</h2>
<p>Smart contract hugely expands the area of blockchain applications, but nothing comes without cost. The ability of executing abitrary code brings capability and flexibility but also more vulnerability to attack such as bugs, hacking, or viruses. Bugs in customer contract codes are particularly critical because of the system’s irreversable and immutable nature. Therefore, it is essential to develop formal methods, mechanisms and tools to validate, verify and guarantee the correctnees of smart contracts before they are deployed to production network.<span class="citation" data-cites="reyna2018iot">(Reyna et al., 2018)</span></p>
<h2 id="consensus"><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Consensus</h2>
<p>Consensus mechanisms are fundamental for the transpancy, verification and trust without central authorisation in blockchain network. The most popular consensus is Proof of Work(PoW) which has been working successfully in Bitcoin. However, PoW has shortcomings such as low transaction rate and high latency as mentioned before, and furthermore, is highly computationally intensive and results in huge amount of energy consumption. Not suprisingly many alternatives and improved consensus mechanisms are proposed, such as Proof of Stake (PoS), Leased Proof of Stake (LPoS), Proof of Burn (PoB), Proof of Importance (PoI), activity test (PoA), Elapsed Time Test (PoET), and Proof of Capacity (PoC). However,consensus mechanisms have not been appropriately formally proved thus remain an open area.<span class="citation" data-cites="reyna2018iot">(Reyna et al., 2018)</span></p>
<h1 id="a-research-paper"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> A Research Paper</h1>
<!-- Describe ONE research paper related to this application of or development using this technology from an academic journal -->
<h1 id="impacts-and-future-directions"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Impacts and Future Directions</h1>
<!-- Evaluate the impact of the technology on software development in the future -->
<p>Blockchain system was created with characteristics of decentralisation, immutability and transparency. It enables an infrastructure layer and a new paradigm for software development. Empowered by blockchain, developers can create secure and autonomous-running applications. Blockchain is seen as the next generation of internet.</p>
<h2 id="smart-contract-and-dapp"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Smart Contract and dApp</h2>
<p>One of the most significant consequence of blockchain is dApps enabled by Smart Contract. Empowered by the verifiable and decentralised nature of blockchain, dApps is an innovative and promising software development paradigm. A increasing number of dApps are being created, including games, user-generated context (UGC) network, supply chain management. Blockchain and dApps are still in its early stage but some researchers believe we are at the start of a new era of decentralised computing which will eventually lead the internet service into next generation.<span class="citation" data-cites="cai2018dapp">(Cai et al., 2018)</span></p>
<h2 id="transparent-decentralised-file-storage-database"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Transparent, Decentralised File Storage &amp; Database</h2>
<p>The fundamental concepts of blockchain can also enables decentralised, transpancy and secure data storage on peer-to-peer networks. It will have lower data loss rate and lower costs. The decentralised data storage will benefit large-scale web applications.</p>
<h2 id="decentralised-software-engineering-tools"><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Decentralised Software Engineering Tools</h2>
<p>Blockchain technology not only brings about new software infrastructure and programming paradigm, but also could revolutionise software engineering itself. The key concepts in blockchain can bring about more trustable and efficient collaboration into software development and benefit many stages in software development lifecycle. For example, a decentralised continuous integration(CI) system and package manager were investigated.<span class="citation" data-cites="Beller:2019:BSE">(Beller &amp; Hejderup, 2019)</span> Decentralised version control system such as Git can also be expected.</p>
